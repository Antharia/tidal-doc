It includes a simple and flexible notation for rhythmic sequences, and an extensive library of patterning functions for combining and transforming them. This allows you to quickly create complex patterns from simple ingredients. By default sound is made with the featureful SuperDirt synth/sampler, but you can control other synths using Open Sound Control or MIDI. Whether you're using SuperDirt or a synth, every filter and effect can be manipulated independently with Tidal patterns.
