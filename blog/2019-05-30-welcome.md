I've started working on a major overhaul / reorganization of the old [Tidal Userbase](https://tidalcycles.org/Userbase) website. It means that this website is not the Tidal Cycles documentation (yet!). Please refer to the old version for more information about Tidal Cycles.

## Documentation reorganization

### "Aesthetic" aspect of things 

I've customized the landing page just a little bit, just enough to make it feel like a real landing page and not like the Docusaurus template. I don't know really know how to customize it more. If you have technical web skills (CSS/JavaScript/HTML), you can go ahead and make a nice landing page!


### Newcomers section

The `Presentation` section will present very general information about Tidal Cycles: what it is? how to install it? what do I need to play? It will not give you any information about the library/language itself. It is entirely focused on dealing with the installation process that is still a barrier of entry for many musicians. I still need to do a tour of the various chat/forum platforms to report the solution to very common installation problems. If you feel like helping me to do so, please proceed :smile: .

There is a whole section dedicated to text editors. This way, newcomers will know that they need to install many separate components, including the text editor they prefer. I've gathered some tips and tricks that were scatterred on the old documentation in monolithic pages dedicated to each text editor. I imagine the editor pages as something that can be easily extended to include more information and customization tricks.
