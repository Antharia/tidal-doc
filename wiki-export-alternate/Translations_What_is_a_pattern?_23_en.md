Here is that function from time to events we were talking about earlier.
We simplified a bit - it's a function from a timespan plus some
additional state, to events. Notice the

``` Haskell
a
```

is carried from the type of the events to the type of the query. This
again shows how a particular pattern can only represent events of the
same type.
