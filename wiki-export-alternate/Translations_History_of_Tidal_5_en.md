From there it wasn't long until [Mike Hodnick](http://kindohm.com/)
discovered Tidal, and started his intensive [365 tidal
patterns](http://blog.kindohm.com/2014/09/14/365-tidal-patterns-finished)
project. The first person to do something often gets the credit, but I
like the idea that it's the [second person to get into something who's
really making the leap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ). So
thanks to Mike and all the amazing people who've followed in making
Tidal their own.
