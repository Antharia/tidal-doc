A page for thoughts and ideas about this wiki.

There's also a short guide for [[Help:How to contribute|how to contribute]]

= Ideas for this wiki =

* Step by Step tutorials about integrating new SynthDefs, custom samples. 
* Tutorial covering the technical aspect of Tidal Cycles : how does Tidal interacts with SuperCollider, etc...
* Gentle intro to Haskell with a Tidal focus, creating custom functions, etc..
* List of useful links to other websites, notable users blogs, etc..
* Link also to related systems - siren, estuary, troop, editor plugins etc.
* Performance examples (code).
* Troubleshooting errors
* Establish purpose of wiki (to help guide contributions) - maybe a new section in [[How to contribute]]?
* Offline version of the docs for inclusion in packages and workspaces without net.

= Tasks ongoing = 

* Transfer everything from https://tidalcycles.org/functions.html into [[:Category:Functions|the functions category]]
* Cover undocumented functions in [[:Category:Functions]] too
* Bring stuff over into the [[:Category:Reference]] category too, and update it in the process.
* Translation into more (human) languages

= Tasks done! =

* <del>Reproduce full installation docs from tidalcycles.org.</del>
