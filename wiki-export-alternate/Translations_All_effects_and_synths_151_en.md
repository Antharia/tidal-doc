"decay" - use larger values to damp higher harmonics (default 0)
"velocity" - higher velocity will brighten the sound a bit (default 1)
"accelerate" - for a linear pitch bend "modamp" - amplitude of the
tremolo (0-2 is OK, default 1) "modfreq" - frequency of the tremolo
(default 7) "detune" - adjusts a high harmonic to give the sound a
different character
