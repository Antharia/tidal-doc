Your code editor may have a keystroke to comment a single line.  If you are structuring your code as a multiline block, you can quickly remove / add back in one or more functions that share a single line.  Essentially 'muting' it from your pattern.

In Atom, the keystroke is Ctrl + / 

In this example, all the delay parameters are grouped on a single line, and the delay can be muted quickly by commenting and re-evaluating the code block.
<source>
d1 $ sound "808oh*4" 
#delayfeedback 0.75 # delaytime (segment 2 $ choose[3,5,7]/32) # delay 0.5
</source>

Additionally, some functions have a value/default value that will negate their effect on the pattern. A few examples:
* speed 1
* fast 1
* slow 1

You could use '''const''' to replace the pattern with a blank one (note: this affects the whole pattern).
<source>
d1 $ (const $ sound "" ) $ sound "808(5,8)" 
</source>

If a function requires another function as an input, you may be able to mute with the <source inline>id</source> aka the Haskell identity function.  This can also be helpful as a placeholder

Compare these two examples, the first has transposition as part of the <source inline>stut'</source>, the second replaces that function with <source inline>id</source>, effectively muting the transposition
<source>
d1 $ stut' 2 (1/16) (+ note "1") $ sound "808(3,8)"
</source>

<source>
d1 $ stut' 2 (1/16) (id) $ sound "808(3,8)"
</source>
