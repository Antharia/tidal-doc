An example of additive synthesis, building up a gong-like noise from a sum of sine-wave harmonics. Notice how the envelope timescale and amplitude can be scaled as a function of the harmonic frequency. "voice" provides something like a tone knob, and "decay" adjusts how the harmonics decay as in the other SynthDefs, "sustain" affects the overall envelope timescale and "accelerate" for pitch glide.
