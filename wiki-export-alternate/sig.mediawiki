[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>sig :: (Time -> a) -> Pattern a</syntaxhighlight>

'''sig''' takes a function of time and turns it into a pattern. It's very useful for creating continuous patterns such as [[sine]] or [[perlin]]. For example, [[saw]] is defined as

<source>
saw = sig $ \t -> mod' (fromRational t) 1
</source>
