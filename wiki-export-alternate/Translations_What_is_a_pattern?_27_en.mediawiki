An important feature of Tidal is that you can accurately compose analogue (continuous) and digital (discrete) patterns together. For example it can be nice to multiply a discrete pattern of notes by a continuously varying sinewave. It's a bit of a myth that computers can only represent digital structures, but when it comes to combining analogue and digital patterns together, it's useful to be able to know which is which, hence the above datatype for doing that.
