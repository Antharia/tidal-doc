A bit of backstory.. I was mainly performing as part of the band
[slub](http://slub.org) (which we started around the year 2000), and
prior to that using a system I made for live coding in Perl called
feedback.pl, which you can read about in my 2004 article [Hacking Perl
in Nightclubs](https://www.perl.com/pub/2004/08/31/livecode.html/). We
were (and still are) part of an international live coding collective
called [TOPLAP](https://toplap.org/).
