[[Type signatures|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline> compress :: (Time, Time) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a </syntaxhighlight>

'''compress''' takes a pattern and ''squeezes'' it within the specified time span (i.e. the 'arc').
The new resulting pattern is a sped up version of the original.

<source>
d1 $ compress (1/4, 3/4) $ s "[bd sn]!"
</source>

In the above example, the pattern will play in an arc spanning from 25% to 75% of the duration of a cycle. It is equivalent to:

<source>
d1 $ s "~ [bd sn]! ~"
</source>

Another example, where all events are different:
<source>
d1 $ compress (1/4, 3/4) $ n (run 4) # s "arpy"
</source>


It differs from [[zoom]] in that it preserves the original pattern but it speeds up its events so to match with the new time period.
