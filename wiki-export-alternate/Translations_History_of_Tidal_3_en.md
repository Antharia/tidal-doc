Anyway I got hooked on exploring pattern with pure functional
programming, and Tidal became pretty central to my [PhD
thesis](http://slab.org/thesis/).. I was lucky enough to be in the
position of spending those 3-4 years (2007-2011) reading around,
thinking about and writing about what I thought I was doing with it. As
well as the afore-mentioned BP2, A short essay by [Laurie Spiegel about
pattern language](http://retiary.org/ls/writings/musical_manip.html) was
a huge influence.. and I also dreamed of a [visuo-spatial interface for
it](https://slab.org/colourful-texture/) which I still haven't found the
time to properly follow up on.
