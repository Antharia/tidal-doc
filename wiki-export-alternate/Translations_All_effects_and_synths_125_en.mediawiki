Snare drum using Rumble-San's implementation as a starting point (http://blog.rumblesan.com/post/53271713909/drum-sounds-in-supercollider-part-2) Again using "n" for some variation on frequency, "decay" for scaling noise duration relative to tonal part, "sustain" for overall timescale, "accelerate" for tonal glide.
