One way to debug OSC is to use a packet sniffer like
[wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). You can put "osc" in the filter
field (no double quotes) to filter out everything except OSC packets. If
you click on an OSC network packet and expand fields you can find a
nicely formatted representation of your OSC message.
