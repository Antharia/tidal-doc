# Techniques

As TidalCycles is a language about patterns, it seems fit to discuss
techniques or 'metapatterns', which we can loosely define as 'patterns
of patterns'. Use this page to describe:

-   activity/techniques in your approach to livecoding
-   code structure or combinations of functions
-   snippets that you've found useful
-   BootTidal hacks
-   etc

The intent is provide a scratch pad for ideas that may not need a full
tutorial

## Patterns

[Muting functions](/wiki/Muting_functions "wikilink")
