<small>(SuperCollider documentation for PV\_ConformalMap: Applies the
conformal mapping z â†’ (z - a) / (1 - za\*) to the phase vocoder bins z
with a given by the real and imag inputs to the UGen. Makes a
transformation of the complex plane so the output is full of phase
vocoder artifacts but may be musically fun. Usually keep \|a\| &lt; 1
but you can of course try bigger values to make it really noisy. a = 0
should give back the input mostly unperturbed. See
<http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConformalMapping.html> )</small>
