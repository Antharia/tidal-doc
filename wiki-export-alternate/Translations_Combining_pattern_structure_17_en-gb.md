You can see the structure comes from the

``` Haskell
2
```

and

``` Haskell
3
```

.

``` Haskell
2
```

lines up with

``` Haskell
4
```

, and the start of

``` Haskell
3
```

is in

``` Haskell
5
```

, so you end up with

``` Haskell
2+4=6
```

and

``` Haskell
3+5=8
```

. The result is the equivalent of

``` Haskell
"6 8"
```
