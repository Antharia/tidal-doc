[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>choose :: [a] -> Pattern a</syntaxhighlight>

<!--T:2-->
The '''choose''' function emits a stream of randomly choosen values from the given list, as a [[Oscillators|continuous]] pattern. 

<!--T:3-->
<source>
d1 $ sound "drum ~ drum drum" # n (choose [0,2,3])
</source>

<!--T:4-->
As with all [[Oscillators|continuous patterns]], you have to be careful to give them structure; in this case '''choose''' gives you an infinitely detailed stream of random choices.

= chooseBy = <!--T:11-->
[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>chooseBy :: Pattern Double -> [a] -> Pattern a</syntaxhighlight>

<!--T:12-->
The '''chooseBy''' function is like [[choose]] but instead of selecting elements of the list randomly, it uses the given pattern to select elements.

<!--T:13-->
<source>
chooseBy "0 0.25 0.5" ["a","b","c","d"]
</source>

<!--T:14-->
will result in the pattern '''"a b c"'''

= wchoose = <!--T:5-->

<!--T:6-->
[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>wchoose :: [(a, Double)] -> Pattern a</syntaxhighlight>

<!--T:7-->
'''wchoose''' is similar to [[choose]], but allows you to 'weight' the choices, so some are more likely to be chosen than others. The following is similar to the previous example, but the 2 is twice as likely to be chosen than the 0 or 3.

<!--T:8-->
<source>
d1 $ sound "drum ~ drum drum" # n (wchoose [(0,0.25),(2,0.5),(3,0.25)])
</source>

<!--T:9-->
''Note: prior to version 1.0.0 of tidal, the weights had to add up to 1, but this is no longer the case.''

= wchooseBy = <!--T:15-->
[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>wchooseBy :: Pattern Double -> [(a,Double)] -> Pattern a </syntaxhighlight>

<!--T:16-->
The '''wchooseBy''' function is like [[wchoose]] but instead of selecting elements of the list randomly, it uses the given pattern to select elements.
