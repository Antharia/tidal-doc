[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>orbit :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern</source>

'''orbit''' is used to separate out audio channels. One use is to deal with global effects such as [[room]] and [[delay]].

For example if you run both of the following patterns at the same time, the reverb will switch on and off, seemingly at random. This is because reverb is a global effect, is therefore shared by both patterns, and one is trying to turn it on, while the other is trying to switch it off.

d1 $ sound "feel*4" # room 0.9 # sz 0.9

d2 $ sound "bd*16" # room 0
</source>

The answer is to put them into different orbits:

<source>
d1 $ sound "feel*4" # room 0.9 # sz 0.9 # orbit 0

d2 $ sound "bd*16" # room 0 # orbit 1
</source>

Orbits can also be used for sending out [[Separate audio outputs|separate audio outputs]] to external software, such as a DAW.

There are two orbits (0 and 1) available by default, but you can add more by [[Configuring SuperDirt]].
