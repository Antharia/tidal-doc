TidalCycles was initiated by Alex McLean around 2009 during doctoral
work funded by EPSRC. Alex's ongoing work on Tidal is partly supported
by Ko-Fi contributors and the
[PENELOPE](https://penelope.hypotheses.org/) project (under the Horizon
2020 research and innovation programme of the European Union, grant
agreement No 682711).
