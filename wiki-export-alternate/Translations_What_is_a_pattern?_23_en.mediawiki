Here is that function from time to events we were talking about earlier. We simplified a bit - it's a function from a timespan plus some additional state, to events. Notice the <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>a</syntaxhighlight> is carried from the type of the events to the type of the query. This again shows how a particular pattern can only represent events of the same type.
