For discussion and community support join the [https://toplap.lurk.org/c/communities/tidalcycles TidalCycles community] on https://toplap.lurk.org/

The above forum is accessible via web forum and email. It's new, and in the process of replacing the legacy [https://we.lurk.org/postorius/lists/tidal.we.lurk.org/ tidal mailing list].

= Chat =

For more immediate, interactive chatter, join https://talk.lurk.org/, which has the following tidal channels (along with channels for a lot of other live coding topics and systems)

* [https://talk.lurk.org/channel/tidal #tidal] - general channel, anything tidal-related goes
* [https://talk.lurk.org/channel/tidal-install #tidal-install] - in-depth help with installing tidal takes place here
* [https://talk.lurk.org/channel/tidal-snippets #tidal-snippets] - where you can share interesting/weird tidal patterns
* [https://talk.lurk.org/channel/tidal-innards #tidal-innards] - we don't like separating end-user live coders from tidal developers too much, but discussion around the tidal 'innards' goes on here
* [https://talk.lurk.org/channel/tidal-doc #tidal-doc] - coordination around the tidal documentation effort
* [https://talk.lurk.org/channel/algorave #algorave], [https://talk.lurk.org/channel/algorave #livecode] etc - meet people using other live coding environments
* There's a lot more!
