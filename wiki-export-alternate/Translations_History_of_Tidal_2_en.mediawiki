A bit of backstory.. I was mainly performing as part of the band [http://slub.org slub] (which we started around the year 2000), and prior to that using a system I made for live coding in Perl called feedback.pl, which you can read about in my 2004 article [https://www.perl.com/pub/2004/08/31/livecode.html/ Hacking Perl in Nightclubs]. We were (and still are) part of an international live coding collective called [https://toplap.org/ TOPLAP].
