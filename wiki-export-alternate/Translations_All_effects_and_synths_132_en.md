sustain - scales overall duration  
decay(0) - amount of decay after initial attack  
accelerate(0) - pitch glide  
semitone(12) - how far off in pitch the secondary oscillator is (need
not be integer)  
pitch1(1) - filter frequency scaling multiplier, the frequency itself
follows the pitch set by "n"  
speed(1)- LFO rate  
lfo(1) - how much the LFO affects the filter frequency  
resonance(0.2) - filter resonance  
voice(0.5) - depends on the individual synth
