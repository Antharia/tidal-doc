'''every''' is function, that allows you to apply another function conditionally. It takes three inputs, how often the function should be applied (e.g. <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>3</syntaxhighlight> to apply it every 3 cycles), the function to be applied, and the pattern you are applying it to.
