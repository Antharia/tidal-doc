The <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>$</syntaxhighlight> is used a ''lot'' in Haskell (the language which Tidal lives inside). Like a lot of things in Haskell, <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>$</syntaxhighlight> is a ''function''. Like all operators (e.g. <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>+</syntaxhighlight>), it has two inputs - the left side, and the right side, and has one output. The left input must be a function, and all that <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>$</syntaxhighlight> does is pass what's on the right hand side, and give it to that function.
