Compare this function with [jux](jux "wikilink") which works similarly
but pans the two versions of the pattern left and right,
[off](off "wikilink") which offsets the modified pattern in time, and
[layer](layer "wikilink") which works like superimpose but allows you to
layer up the results of more than one function.
