= Install Supercollider =
Installing supercollider via this method (i.e. <code>sudo apt-get install supercollider sc3-plugins</code>) generally doesn't work. Either the supercollider version is too old (superdirt needs at least version 3.7), or the version of supercollider is mismatched with sc3-plugins. If you're using ubuntu, mint or a similar distribution, my advice is to ignore the supercollider packages and just compile them yourself. Instructions for compiling from source on various distros is available [https://supercollider.github.io/development/building.html here]. If you're using a recent Debian-based distro (for example, Ubuntu >= 18.04), these scripts make it easy to do so:
