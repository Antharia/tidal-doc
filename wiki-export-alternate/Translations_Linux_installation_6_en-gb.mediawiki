It ''should'' be possible to install supercollider via this method too, via <source lang="shell">supercollider sc3-plugins</source>. However this generally doesn't work. Either the supercollider version is too old (superdirt needs at least version 3.7), or the version of supercollider is mismatched with sc3-plugins. If you're using ubuntu, mint or a similar distribution, my advice is to ignore the supercollider packages and just compile them yourself. These scripts make it super easy to do so:
