An ''event'' then, consists of a part, and a value of type <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>a</syntaxhighlight>. This <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>a</syntaxhighlight> can stand for ''any'' type (but you can only have events of the same type in any one pattern). For example you can have a pattern of words, of numbers, of colours or even of other patterns..
