A '''Higher-order function''' is a function that accepts a function among its parameters. Simply put, it's any function takes one or more other functions as input.

Because patterns are themselves functions of time, strictly speaking ''all'' functions that work with patterns are higher-order. However to make this category useful we ignore this fact!
