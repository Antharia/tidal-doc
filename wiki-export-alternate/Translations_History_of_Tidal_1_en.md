Tidal was originally made by [Alex McLean](/wiki/User%3AYaxu "wikilink") (who
is writing this bit right now), while a postgrad student in Goldsmiths
in London. It started around 2006, with a DSL to explore pattern
rotation presented at a 'pecha kucha' inspired event organised by Tom
Carden in London ([video
here](http://toxi.co.uk/blog/2006/07/ask-later-not-t-k-event.htm), from
15 minute mark, [slides here](http://slab.org/archive/20/20.pdf) and
videos [here](http://slab.org/archive/20/pl.avi) (for feedback.pl
precursor) and [here](http://slab.org/archive/20/hs.avi) (for the
haskell experiment)). This was developed further in 2007 into a system
for "computational creativity", used to analyse rhythmic continuation in
sound poetry, using Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate as an example (see section
4.1 of [my MSc
thesis](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/99ac/092d014aac16728912563975282e20039e19.pdf)
for details). Like the Bol Processor 2 (BP2) software it was inspired
by, I started off making it for analysis of rhythmic structure, but
quickly switched to making it for synthesis, i.e. for making new musical
structure. I can't remember the first time I performed with it, probably
not too long after that. We lived fast back then!
