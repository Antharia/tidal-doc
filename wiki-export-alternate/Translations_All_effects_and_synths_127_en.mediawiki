Hand clap using Rumble-San's implementation as a starting point (http://blog.rumblesan.com/post/53271713909/drum-sounds-in-supercollider-part-2) "delay" controls the echo delay, "speed" will affect the decay time, "n" changes how spread is calculated, "pitch1" will scale the bandpass frequency, and "sustain" the overall timescale.
