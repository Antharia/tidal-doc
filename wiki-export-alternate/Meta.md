A page for thoughts and ideas about this wiki.

There's also a short guide for [how to
contribute](/wiki/Help:How_to_contribute "wikilink")

# Ideas for this wiki

-   Step by Step tutorials about integrating new SynthDefs, custom
    samples.
-   Tutorial covering the technical aspect of Tidal Cycles : how does
    Tidal interacts with SuperCollider, etc...
-   Gentle intro to Haskell with a Tidal focus, creating custom
    functions, etc..
-   List of useful links to other websites, notable users blogs, etc..
-   Link also to related systems - siren, estuary, troop, editor plugins
    etc.
-   Performance examples (code).
-   Troubleshooting errors
-   Establish purpose of wiki (to help guide contributions) - maybe a
    new section in [How to contribute](/wiki/How_to_contribute "wikilink")?
-   Offline version of the docs for inclusion in packages and workspaces
    without net.

# Tasks ongoing

-   Transfer everything from <https://tidalcycles.org/functions.html>
    into [the functions category](/wiki/Category%3AFunctions "wikilink")
-   Cover undocumented functions in
    [Category%3AFunctions](/wiki/Category%3AFunctions "wikilink") too
-   Bring stuff over into the
    [Category%3AReference](/wiki/Category%3AReference "wikilink") category
    too, and update it in the process.
-   Translation into more (human) languages

# Tasks done!

-   ~~Reproduce full installation docs from tidalcycles.org.~~
