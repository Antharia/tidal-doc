This is because of the way Tidal handles time. There is a universal
‘cycle’ (sort of like a musical 'bar') which is always running. Tidal
will play all of the sounds between the speech marks in one cycle,
unless we tell it not to (we’ll learn how to do that later). You’ll also
notice Tidal will space the sounds out evenly within the cycle Which
means we can end up with polyrhythmic structures (more on those later).
