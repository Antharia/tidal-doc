Hammond B3 sim. Freq adjustments courtesy Tom Wiltshire (electricdruid.net). Drawbar settings selectable with "voice" and from many public domain sources, Google "Hammond drawbar settings" and add your own in the big SelectX block (in SC)."perc" "percf" and "decay" are an attempt at the percussion, no idea if it sounds at all reasonable. vintage Hammonds had percf as 2 or 3 (switchable), two perc levels (maybe roughly 0.7 and 1.2?), and two decay options (roughly 0 and maybe 1ish?). "vibrato", "vrate", "perc", "percf" are all new params you'll need to define in Tidal if you want to change them.
