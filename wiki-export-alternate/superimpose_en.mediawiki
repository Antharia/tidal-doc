[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>superimpose :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''superimpose''' plays a modified version of a pattern 'on top of' the original pattern, resulting in the modified and original version of the patterns being played at the same time. For example this:

<source>
d1 $ superimpose (fast 2) $ sound "bd sn [cp ht] hh"
</source>

...is the same as this:

<source>
d1 $ stack [sound "bd sn [cp ht] hh",
            fast 2 $ sound "bd sn [cp ht] hh"
           ]
</source>

Compare this function with [[jux]] which works similarly but pans the two versions of the pattern left and right, [[off]] which offsets the modified pattern in time, and [[layer]] which works like superimpose but allows you to layer up the results of more than one function.
