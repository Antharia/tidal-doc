[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>jux :: (ControlPattern -> ControlPattern) -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern</source>

The '''jux''' function creates strange stereo effects, by applying a function to a pattern, but only in the right-hand channel. For example, the following reverses the pattern on the righthand side:

<source>
d1 $ slow 32 $ jux (rev) $ striate' 32 (1/16) $ sound "bev"
</source>

When passing functions to functions like jux and [[every]], itâ€™s possible to chain multiple transforms together with <source inline>.</source>, for example this both reverses and halves the playback speed of the pattern in the righthand channel:

<source>
d1 $ slow 32 $ jux ((# speed "0.5") . rev) $ striate' 32 (1/16) $ sound "bev"
</source>

= juxBy =

[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>juxBy :: Pattern Double -> (ControlPattern -> ControlPattern) -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern</source>

With jux, the original and effected versions of the pattern are panned hard left and right (i.e., panned at 0 and 1). This can be a bit much, especially when listening on headphones. The variant '''juxBy''' has an additional parameter, which brings the channel closer to the centre. For example:

<source>
d1 $ juxBy 0.5 (fast 2) $ sound "bd sn:1"
</source>

In the above, the two versions of the pattern would be panned at 0.25 and 0.75, rather than 0 and 1.
