The above states that time is rational. This means that rather than representing time as integers (whole numbers), or as floating point numbers, Tidal represents time as a ratio of ''two'' integers. This means that for example a third can be represented precisely, as one over three. Music is of course full of such ratios, and not representing them as such can cause a great deal of problems.. Basically, this means that if you add three one-thirds together, you'll get a whole. Seems obvious but not all systems do this!
