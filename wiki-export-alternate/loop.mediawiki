[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>loop :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''loop''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that changes the number of times a sample plays from its [[begin]] and [[end]] points. A negative value behaves the same as its positive counterpart. With fractional '''loop''' values, the final iteration will be incomplete - for example, a value of '''2.3''' loops thrice with the final loop playing 30% of the sample between its [[begin]] and [[end]] points.

d1 $ s "ho" # loop "2.2"

To alter the loop points, you can use [[begin]] and [[end]].
