This is very similar to how <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>|+|</syntaxhighlight> used to work in the versions of tidal prior to 1.0.0 - it took structure from the left, but values from the right. In fact, <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>#</syntaxhighlight> is an alias for <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>|></syntaxhighlight>, mirroring the behaviour in previous versions of tidal.
