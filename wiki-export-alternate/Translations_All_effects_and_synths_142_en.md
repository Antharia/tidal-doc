Uses the Atari ST emulation UGen with 3 oscillators. "slide" is for a
linear frequency glide that will repeat "speed" times (can be fractional
or negative). "accelerate" is for an overall glide, "pitch2" and
"pitch3" control the ratio of harmonics. "voice" causes variations in
the levels of the 3 oscillators
