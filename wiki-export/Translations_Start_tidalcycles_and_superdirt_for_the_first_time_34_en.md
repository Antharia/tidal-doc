Head over to the [Linux installation](/wiki/Linux_installation "wikilink") to
install the Emacs plugin if you haven't done it already. Once the Tidal
plugin is installed, all you need to do is to open a `*.tidal` file and
press `C-c C-s` to start Tidal in Emacs. If everything went fine you
should see Tidal's output showing up in a separate window.
