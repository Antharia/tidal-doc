To return to an earlier version of tidal, use the <source inline lang="bash">ghc-pkg</source> command. For example:

<source lang="bash">
ghc-pkg list tidal
</source>

The above will list the version or versions you have installed. If there is more than one, the most recent will be used.

To uninstall a version, you can do, for example:

<source lang="bash">
ghc-pkg unregister tidal-1.0.6
</source>

Do this for each version until the most recent is the one you want. 

If you don't have the one you want installed, you can do this:

<source lang="bash">
cabal install tidal-0.9.10
</source>

= Atom editor package =

You will probably also need to install an old version of the atom package to match. You can do this from the commandline too. For example, to install a version of the atom package compatible with tidal 0.9.x, you can do this:

<source lang="bash">
apm install tidalcycles@0.12.1
</source>
