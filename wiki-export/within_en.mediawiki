{{Type|<source inline>within :: Arc -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>}}

Use '''within''' to apply a function to only a part of a pattern. '''within''' takes two arguments: a start time and an end time, specified as floats between 0 and 1, which are applied to the relevant pattern. Note that the second argument must be greater than the first for the function to have any effect.

For example, to apply <source inline>fast 2</source> to only the first half of a pattern:

<source>
d1 $ within (0, 0.5) (fast 2) $ sound "bd*2 sn lt mt hh hh hh hh"
</source>

Or, to apply <source inline>(# speed "0.5")</source> to only the last quarter of a pattern:

<source>
d1 $ within (0.75, 1) (# speed "0.5") $ sound "bd*2 sn lt mt hh hh hh hh"
</source>
