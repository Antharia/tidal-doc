<!--T:1-->
To avoid problems, we warmly recommend upgrading all three components of TidalCycles together - the tidalcycles library itself, the editor plugin, and the SuperDirt synth.

= TidalCycles library = <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
Upgrade tidal with the following from a terminal window:

<!--T:4-->
<source lang="shell">
cabal update
cabal install tidal --lib
</source>

If you're using an older version of haskell you might have to miss the `--lib` off the above command.

= Editor plugin = <!--T:10-->

<!--T:11-->
To upgrade your tidalcycles editor plugin (which might be referred to as an 'extension' or 'package'). In atom, you can do this via the preferences > updates menu.

<!--T:12-->
In VSCode, you can upgrade the TidalCycles package by viewing your extensions (View > Extensions menu, or click on the Extensions icon on the left-hand activity bar), searching for TidalCycles and then choose to upgrade. 

= SuperDirt = <!--T:13-->

<!--T:14-->
To upgrade the SuperDirt sound synthesiser/sampler, open supercollider, and run the following (paste it in, put your cursor on that line, hit shift-enter):

<!--T:15-->
<source lang="c">
Quarks.update("SuperDirt")
</source>

<!--T:16-->
After this, you'll need to recompile the class library. You can do this either by restarting supercollider, or via the "Recompile class library" entry on the "Language" menu.
