Digital noise in several flavors with a bandpass filter. "voice" at 0 is
a digital noise for which "n" controls rate, at 1 is Brown+White noise
for which "n" controls knee frequency. "accelerate" causes glide in n,
"speed" will cause it to repeat. "pitch1" scales the bandpass frequency
(which tracks "n"). "slide" works like accelerate on the bandpass.
"resonance" is the filter resonance.
