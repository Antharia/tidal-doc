[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>[a -> Pattern b] -> a -> Pattern b</source>

The '''layer''' function allows you to layer up multiple functions on one pattern.

For example the following will play two versions of the pattern at the same time, one reversed and one at twice the speed. 

<source>
d1 $ layer [rev, fast 2] $ sound "arpy [~ arpy:4]"
</source>

If you want to include the original version of the pattern in the layering, use the <source inline>id</source> function:

<source>
d1 $ layer [id, rev, fast 2] $ sound "arpy [~ arpy:4]"
</source>

This function is related to [[superimpose]], in particular <source inline>layer [id, rev]</source> is the same as <source inline>superimpose rev</source>.
