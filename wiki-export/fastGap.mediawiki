[[Type signature|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>fastGap :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</syntaxhighlight>

'''fastGap''' speeds up a pattern like [[fast]], but rather than it playing multiple times as <source inline> fast</source> would it instead leaves a ''gap'' in the remaining space of the cycle. For example, the following will play the sound pattern "bd sn" only once but compressed into the first half of the cycle, i.e. twice as fast.

<source>
d1 $ sound (fastGap 2 "bd sn")
</source>

'''See also: [[fast]].'''
