Kick Drum using Rumble-San's implementation as a starting point
(http://blog.rumblesan.com/post/53271713518/drum-sounds-in-supercollider-part-1). "n" controls the kick frequency in a nonstandard way. "sustain" affects overall envelope timescale, "accelerate" sweeps the click filter freq, "pitch1" affects the click frequency, and "decay" changes the click duration relative to the overall timescale.
