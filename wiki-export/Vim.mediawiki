Vim is another classic programmer’s editor, with a more minimalistic approach than others, and famous for its peculiar and unique editing modes and hotkeys.

Because Vim doesn’t have native support for REPLs or interactive buffers, the [https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal vim-tidal] plugin depends on tmux, a terminal multiplexer, to communicate between Vim and the Tidal interpreter.

See [https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal vim-tidal] for more information on how to install and use.
