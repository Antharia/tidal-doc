That's the basics, lets have a look at some code. The core
representation for patterns is in the
[Sound.Tidal.Pattern](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/master/src/Sound/Tidal/Pattern.hs)
module. The core representation is in the ten or so lines at the top.
Lets step through it. Some Haskell knowledge will be helpful here, but
you will hopefully get the gist even without software development
experience.
