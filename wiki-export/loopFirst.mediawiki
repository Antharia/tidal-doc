[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>loopFirst :: Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''loopFirst''' is a function that takes a pattern and loops only the first cycle of the pattern. For example, in the following code will ''only'' play the bass drum sample.

<source>
d1 $ loopFirst $ s "<<bd*4 ht*8> cp*4>"
</source>

<source>
d1 $ sometimes loopFirst $ s "<<bd*4 ht*8> cp*4>"
