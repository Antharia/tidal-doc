Tidal was originally made by [[User:Yaxu|Alex McLean]] (who is writing this bit right now), while a postgrad student in Goldsmiths in London. It started around 2006, with a DSL to explore pattern rotation presented at a 'pecha kucha' inspired event organised by Tom Carden in London ([http://toxi.co.uk/blog/2006/07/ask-later-not-t-k-event.htm video here], from 15 minute mark, [http://slab.org/archive/20/20.pdf slides here] and videos [http://slab.org/archive/20/pl.avi here] (for feedback.pl precursor) and [http://slab.org/archive/20/hs.avi here] (for the haskell experiment)). This was developed further in 2007 into a system for "computational creativity", used to analyse rhythmic continuation in sound poetry, using Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate as an example (see section 4.1 of [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/99ac/092d014aac16728912563975282e20039e19.pdf my MSc thesis] for details). Like the Bol Processor 2 (BP2) software it was inspired by, I started off making it for analysis of rhythmic structure, but quickly switched to making it for synthesis, i.e. for making new musical structure. I can't remember the first time I performed with it, probably not too long after that. We lived fast back then!
