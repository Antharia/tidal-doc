Have a look at [https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt SuperDirt's documentation], in particular the example [https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/blob/develop/superdirt_startup.scd superdirt_startup.scd] file.  You'll want to paste the setup code into the supercollider editor window. If you save it in your supercollider startup file it will automatically run when you open supercollider - you can find that file via the menus.
