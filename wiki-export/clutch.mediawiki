[[Type signatures|Type]]: <source inline>clutch :: Time -> [Pattern a] -> Pattern a </source>

'''clutch''' degrades the current pattern while undegrading the next.  The argument provided to `clutch` is the ID of the pattern that `clutch` creates or the pattern that `clutch` is replacing.

This is like [[xfade]] but not by gain of samples but by randomly removing events from the current pattern and slowly adding back in missing events from the next one.

d1 $ sound "bd(3,8)"

clutch 1 $ sound "[hh*4, odx(3,8)]"

'''clutch''' takes two cycles for the transition, essentially this is ''[[clutchIn]] 2''.
