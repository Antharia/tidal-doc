[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>cps :: Pattern Double -> ControlPattern</source>

'''cps''' turns a number pattern into a control pattern that changes the tempo of all running patterns:

<source>
d1 $ s "bd*8" # cps "0.7 1 0.5 1.2"

d1 $ s "bd*8" # cps "<0.7 1 0.5 1.2>"
</source>

This allows for smooth, continuous time stretches with a continuous function:

<source>
d1 $ s "bd*8" # cps (range 1 2 $ slow 4 sine)
</source>

Note that the behavior of '''cps''' is ''global'' and affects all running patterns, even though it only needs to be used on one pattern:

<source>
d1 $ s "bd*8" # cps "<1 1.5 0.75>"

-- this pattern is affected by the cps changes
d2 $ s "cp(3,8)"
</source>
