Start with a pattern on <code>d1</code>:

<source>
d1 $ s "bd(3,8) drum*4"
</source>

You can then perform a crossfade transition to a new pattern using <code>xfade</code>:

<source>
xfade 1 $ s "arpy*8" # n (run 8)
</source>

Note that the argument we give to <code>xfade</code> is "1", which means to apply the transition to the pattern that is running on <code>d1</code>.

You can use transitions on any <code>d</code> pattern in Tidal:

<source>
d3 $ s "bd(3,8)"

xfade 3 $ s "arpy*4"
</source>

You can also apply a transition to any arbitrary pattern name:

<source>
p "drums" $ s "bd(3,8) drum*4"

xfade "drums" $ s "arpy*8" # n (run 8)
</source>

Most of the transitions also have an "In" variant, where you can specify the number of cycles that the transition takes to complete:

<source>
xfadeIn 1 8 $ s "arpy*8" # n (run 8)
</source>

* [[interpolate]], [[interpolateIn]]
* [[jump]], [[jumpIn]], [[jumpIn']], [[jumpMod]]
* [[histpan]]
* [[mortal]]
* [[xfade]], [[xfadeIn]]: applies a crossfade, and fades one pattern out while fading a new pattern in.
* [[wait]], [[waitT]]
* [[wash]], [[washIn]]
