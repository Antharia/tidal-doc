So a pattern is a function from a timespan (also known as an ''arc''), to values with each have a beginning and end. A function like <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>rev</syntaxhighlight>, is therefore a combinator, which takes such a function as input, and gives a new function as output (with input and output timing manipulations baked-in, in order to reverse the pattern).
