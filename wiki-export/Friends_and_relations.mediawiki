Starting a list of projects connected with TidalCycles - ones that interface with/inspired/are inspired by tidal.

(For a long list of _all_ the live coding environments, see the [https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding all things livecoding] list.)

= Ports and parsers =

* [https://github.com/dktr0/estuary Estuary] is a platform for collaboration and learning through live coding, hosting a range of environments in a web-browser, including "minitidal", a parser for tidal

= Editors =

* [https://github.com/dktr0/extramuros Extramuros], a language-neutral shared-buffer networked live coding system in the browser (precursor of Estuary)
* [https://github.com/yaxu/feedforward Feedforward], a strange terminal-based editor in development
* [https://github.com/cannc4/Siren Siren] - a tracker interface for TidalCycles and SuperCollider
* [https://github.com/qirky/troop Troop], a real-time collaborative tool that enables group live coding within the same document across multiple computers. Works with a range of live coding languages, including Tidal

== Editor plugins ==

* [https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/master/tidal.el Emacs]
* [https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Sublime_Text Sublime text]
* [https://github.com/supercollider/scvim vim]
* [https://github.com/tidalcycles/vscode-tidalcycles VS Code]

= Synths and samplers =

* [https://github.com/tidalcycles/dirt Dirt] - the original 'classic' dirt, implemented in c
* [https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/ SuperDirt] - the SuperCollider rewrite, recommended for general use (unless running in a web browser) 
* [https://github.com/dktr0/WebDirt webdirt] - the javascript rewrite, part of estuary

== SuperCollider (or SuperDirt) add-ons ==

* [https://github.com/calumgunn/StageMaster StageMaster] - light mastering chain for use during live performance in SuperCollider

= Visual systems =

* [https://github.com/ivan-abreu/didacticpatternvisualizer Didactic pattern visualizer] - Sound pattern visualizer programmed in Processing
* [https://github.com/Dsm0/p5jsDirt/ p5jsDirt] - integration with p5.js

= Syncing / interfacing =

* [https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/carabiner Carabiner], for bridging with the Link protocol
* [https://github.com/dktr0/espgrid ESPGrid], synchronisation designed for live coding environments including supercollider, foxdot as well as tidal
* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vliegwerk/tidal Node.js interface] for sending messages between javascript and tidal

= Tidal-inspired systems =

* [https://github.com/Mdashdotdashn/krill Krill] - a javascript-based live coding environment inspired by tidal
* [https://github.com/gibber-cc/tidal.pegjs tidal.pegjs] - is a parsing expression grammar for the TidalCycles mini-notation, written using PEG.js. The goal of the PEG is to easily translate strings of Tidal-style mini notation into annotated JavaScript data structures for use in sequencing. Works with [http://gibber.cc/ Gibber] and [https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/ Hydra]!

= Systems that inspired Tidal =

* [http://bolprocessor.sourceforge.net/ Bol processor] - algorithmic music system based on compositional grammars, grown from research into symbolic notation of tabla rhythms
* [http://www.euterpea.com/ Euterpea] is a cross-platform, domain-specific language for computer music applications embedded in the Haskell programming language
* Douglas Repetto's beat rotation experiments, e.g. rotcomposer in [http://www.meapsoft.com/showcase.php MEAPsoft]
