[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>stutter :: Integral i => i -> Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''stutter''' is like [[stut]] that doesn't reduce the volume or [[ply]] if you controlled the timing. <source inline>stutter n t</source> repeats each event in the pattern <source inline>n</source> times, separated by <source inline>t</source> time (in fractions of a cycle).

The code
<source>
d1 $ stutter 4 (1/16) $ s "bd cp"
</source>
should be functionally equivalent to 
<source>
d1 $ stut 4 1 (1/16) $ s "bd cp"
</source>

Specific conveniences functions that use <source inline>stutter</source> are:

<source>
echo   = stutter (2 :: Int)
triple = stutter (3 :: Int)
quad   = stutter (4 :: Int)
double = echo
