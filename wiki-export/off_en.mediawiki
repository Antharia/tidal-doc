[[Type]]: <source inline>Pattern Time -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''off''' is similar to [[superimpose]], in that it applies a function to a pattern, and layers up the results on top of the original pattern. The difference is that <source inline>off</source> takes an extra pattern being a time (in cycles) to shift the transformed version of the pattern by.

The following plays a pattern on top of itself, but offset by an eighth of a cycle, with a distorting bitcrush effect applied.

<source>
d1 $ off 0.125 (# crush 2) $ sound "bd [~ sn:2] mt lt*2"
</source>

The following makes arpeggios by adding offset patterns that are shifted up the scale:

<source>
d1 $ slow 2 $ 
  n (off 0.25 (+12) $ off 0.125 (+7) $ slow 2 "c(3,8) a(3,8,2) f(3,8) e(3,8,4)") 
  # sound "superpiano"
</source>
