[[Category:Transitions]]

<code>jump</code> is essentially the ''no transition''-transition. It jumps directly into the given pattern. The variants [[jumpIn]], [[jumpIn']] and [[jumpMod]] provide more useful capabilities.

'''Example:''' Say you have
<source>
d1 $ sound "hh*4"
</source>
then both of the following lines will have the same effect when evaluated:
<source>
d1 $ sound "hh*8"
jump 1 $ sound "hh*8" --`1` to change the pattern in `d1`
</source>
