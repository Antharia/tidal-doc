<small>(SuperCollider documentation for PV_ConformalMap:
Applies the conformal mapping
z â†’ (z - a) / (1 - za*)
to the phase vocoder bins z with a given by the real and imag inputs to the UGen.
Makes a transformation of the complex plane so the output is full of phase vocoder artifacts but may be musically fun. Usually keep
|a| < 1
but you can of course try bigger values to make it really noisy.
a = 0
should give back the input mostly unperturbed.
