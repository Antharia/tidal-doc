[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>append :: Pattern a -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''append''' combines two patterns into a new pattern, where cycles alternate between the first and second pattern.

<source>
d1 $ append (sound "bd*2 sn") (sound "arpy jvbass*2")
</source>

It has the alias <source inline>slowAppend</source>, in sympathy with [[append#fastAppend|fastAppend]], described below.

= fastAppend =
[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>fastAppend :: Pattern a -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''fastAppend''' works like [[append]] described above, but each pair of cycles from the two patterns are squashed to fit a single cycle.

<source>
d1 $ fastAppend (sound "bd*2 sn") (sound "arpy jvbass*2")
</source>
