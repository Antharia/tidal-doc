[[Type signatures|Type]]: <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" inline>slowSqueeze :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a</syntaxhighlight>

'''fastSqueeze''' slows down a pattern according to the given time pattern. It is the <source inline>slow</source> analogue to [[fastSqueeze]].

If the time pattern only has a single value in a cycle, <source inline>slowSqueeze</source> becomes equivalent to <source inline>slow</source>:
<source>
d1 $ slow "<2 4>" $ s "bd*8"
</source>
is the same as
<source>
d1 $ slowSqueeze "<2 4>" $ s "bd*8"
</source>

but when the time pattern has ''multiple'' values in it the behavior is a little different! Instead, a slowed version of the pattern will be made for each value in the time pattern and then they're ''all'' combined together in a cycle, according to the structure of the time pattern. For example,

<source>
d1 $ slowSqueeze "2 4 8 16" $ s "bd*8"
</source>
is equivalent to
<source>
d1 $ s "bd*4 bd*2 bd bd/2"
</source>
and 
<source>
d1 $ slowSqueeze "2 4 [8 16]" $ s "bd*8"
</source>
is equivalent to
<source>
d1 $ s "bd*4 bd*2 [bd bd/2]"
</source>
