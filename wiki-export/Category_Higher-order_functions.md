A **Higher-order function** is a function that accepts a function among
its parameters. Simply put, it's any function takes one or more other
functions as input.

Because patterns are themselves functions of time, strictly speaking
*all* functions that work with patterns are higher-order. However to
make this category useful we ignore this fact!
