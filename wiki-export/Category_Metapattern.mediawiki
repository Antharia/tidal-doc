As TidalCycles is a language about patterns, it seems fit to discuss '''metapatterns''', which we can loosely define as 'patterns of patterns'.  Use this page to describe patterns of: 
* activity/techniques in your approach to livecoding
* code structure or combinations of functions
* snippets that you've found useful
* BootTidal hacks
* etc
