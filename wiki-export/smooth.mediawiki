[[Type signature|Type]]: <source inline>smooth :: Fractional a => Pattern a -> Pattern a</source>

'''smooth''' blends between the numbers (rational or floating point) in a pattern. It does linear interpolation, that is it will go in a straight line from one number to the next. For example, <source inline>smooth "1 2"</source> will go from 1 to 2 and back to 1 again over one cycle, so that one quarter of the way through it will have the value 1.5.

The result will be an [[Oscillators|oscillator]], which means it does not have structure on its own. You can give it structure simply by combining it with one that does (e.g. <source inline>"0 0 2*2 1" + smooth "0 10 11"</source>), or by using a function like [[segment]] or [[struct]].

<source inline>smooth</source> copes with polyphonic patterns (where events overlap), by running the [[mono]] function internally.
