In Tidal, what *is* a pattern? There are a lot of ways of answering this
question. A technical definition is that under the hood, a pattern is a
function from time to events. You give a pattern a start and end time,
and it gives you back the events that are active (in part or in whole)
during that timespan. An event is itself a value with a start and end
time.
