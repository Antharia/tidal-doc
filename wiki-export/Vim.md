Vim is another classic programmer’s editor, with a more minimalistic
approach than others, and famous for its peculiar and unique editing
modes and hotkeys.

Because Vim doesn’t have native support for REPLs or interactive
buffers, the [vim-tidal](https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal) plugin
depends on tmux, a terminal multiplexer, to communicate between Vim and
the Tidal interpreter.

See [vim-tidal](https://github.com/munshkr/vim-tidal) for more
information on how to install and use.
