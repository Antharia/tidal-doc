That's because the computer will first read <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>fast 2</syntaxhighlight>, then <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>rev</syntaxhighlight>, and try to treat <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>rev</syntaxhighlight> as a pattern to be speeded up. But on its own, <syntaxhighlight lang="Haskell" inline>rev</syntaxhighlight> isn't a pattern, but a function for transforming pattern.
