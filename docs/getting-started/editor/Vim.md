[Vim](https://neovim.io) is the [classic and ubiquitous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) text editor for Unix systems. This editor is famous for his minimalistic approach, his flexibility and for its peculiar and unique editing modes and hotkeys. Vim/Neovim is free, cross-platform and open-source. The software can be extended through the help of plugins, and is generally more configurable than other kind of text editors. Vim has a very long history and has the reputation of being very stable and fast.

Vim is generally used by experienced users: developers, system administrators, tech enthusiasts. It has a steep learning curve, but this allows you, after a while, to be able to edit text at the speed of light and with great precision.

## Vim: Tips and tricks

### Undotree

![undotree](undotree.png)

As suggested by `@guiot` on the **Tidal Club** Forum. You can keep track of your improvisations using the [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree) plugin for Vim/Neovim. Using the undotree wisely is a great way to backtrack in time or to keep a `plaintext` trace of your improvisations. By default, `undotree` will record every little tiny changes in your text file. Activate the `undotree` for a file by entering the `:UndotreeToggle` command.
