These functions are used to turn patterns of strings (words) or numbers
into *control patterns*, which govern how samples are played in the
SuperDirt audio synthesiser (or other software you're controlling with
tidal). This includes audio control functions such as
[gain](gain "wikilink") and [pan](pan "wikilink"), sample manipulation
functions such as [begin](begin "wikilink") and [end](end "wikilink"),
and effect functions such as [delay](delay "wikilink") and
[shape](shape "wikilink").

See the [Control Functions](/wiki/Control_Functions "wikilink") page for a
handy summary of the available control functions.
