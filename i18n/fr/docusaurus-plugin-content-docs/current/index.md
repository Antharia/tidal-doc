Tidalcycles (or just 'Tidal' for short) is software for making
patterns with code, whether live coding music at algoraves or
composing in the studio.

It includes a simple and flexible notation for rhythmic sequences, and
an extensive library of patterning functions for combining and
transforming them. This allows you to quickly create complex patterns
from simple ingredients.

By default sound is made with the featureful *SuperDirt*
synth/sampler, but you can control other synths using Open Sound
Control or MIDI. Whether you're using SuperDirt or a synth, every
filter and effect can be manipulated independently with Tidal
patterns.

You can learn Tidal through experimentation and play - most Tidal
coders have little or no experience in software engineering.
